    "Astute gamers will notice that the season 14 map rotation includes Paramo (one of my personal favorites!), which has a player capacity of 64. All other maps in season 14 and 15 have player capacities of 100. Could it be that the *map selection* in season 14 was based on a uniform categorical distribution, but the fact that Paramo only allows 64 players per round skewed the realized proportion accordingly? As a thought experiment, imagine that the map rotation was deterministically, uniformly generated (e.g. map1, map2, ... ,map_n, map1, map2, ...), but one map only allowed 5 players per round while the rest allowed 500. It makes sense intuitively that while the exclusive map was *selected* the same number of times as the others, the probability of a player landing in a match on that map would be much smaller than for the other maps. \n",

    "Inspection of the data provided by u/attractionist in season 14 indicates that the play count for Paramo is less than the other maps by a scaling constant that is in the neighborhood of 64/100, which would correspond to scaling by the map's player capacity. Let's try scaling the season 14 Paramo match count by this scaling factor and repeating our test.\n"
